    vi is a powerful text editor with origins in Linux. 

    vi operated in two modes, Command mode and Insert mode. 
    Command mode (also called Normal mode) - All keys pressed execute a command rather than adding text to the document. 

    The Linux make utility works by reading and interpreting a Makefile.
    Typically you run make by simply typing the following command at the shell
    prompt.
    
                    make
    
    In this project, after you type 'make' at the shell prompt, it builds
    TARGET specified in the Makefile.
    After this process, if you type:
                    
                    './20171672'
    
    the program will run.

    To delete the executable file and all the object files from the directory,
    type:

                    make clean
